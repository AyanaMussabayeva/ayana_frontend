        "Happy to share that our team MBZUAI (Anuar Aimoldin, Ayana Mussabayeva, and Yedige Mussabayev) took the absolute first place (by combined metric) in the EEG Foundation Challenge, part of the NeurIPS Competition Track 2025!",
        "The challenge consisted of two tasks:",
        "1. Prediction of reaction time from stimulus-locked EEG: where we reframed the problem as temporal segmentation to localize the response event.",
        "2. Prediction of the externalizing factor from EEG (a mental-health-related construct representing a common dimension of psychopathology across disorders)",
        "The final metric combined results from both tasks (30 % Task 1 + 70 % Task 2).",
        "As winners, we were invited to have a spotlight talk at  NeurIPS 2025 in San Diego!",
        "Though I have long experience in machine learning and brain data analysis, this was actually my first ever ML competition, and damn what an experience it\u2019s been! Throughout October, we dedicated nearly every day to this challenge: experimenting, analyzing, learning, and pushing boundaries. Our success wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the amazing balance of our team: from research depth to Kaggle-hardened competition strategy (including a great Kaggle master among us).",
        "So, seems like now I'm going to the U.S. again (third time this year and second time this month). So after using all those lagged correlation features, I guess it\u2019s only fair I\u2019m gonna get lots of jet lag myself!"

        "It\u2019s been a pleasure to attend this huge event and connect with so many inspiring tech leaders. This conference was quite different from those which I usually attend. It was more about networking and personal stories, rather than specific research topics. That was very unusual and exciting. And damn this conference was HUUUGE! The whole building of Chicago\u2019s McCromic\u2019s place was full with female specialists from tech. Going from one session to another might have taken like 20 minutes! It was huge.",
        "Chicago itself has been an amazing place to visit. Beautiful architecture, amazing views of Michigan Lake, dip dish pizza and so much more! Not always feeling safe on those noisy streets, but it was quite fun!",
        "Many thanks to MBZUAI for this opportunity!"

But no one teaches us how to be a woman. And that, in itself, isn't easy, especially for those of us with a Central Asian background.",
        "As a woman from Kazakhstan, I see the constant pressure women endure in my country. Women in high positions, with successful careers and great incomes, are constantly met with comments like, \"<i>When are you going to get married?</i>\" or \"<i>Look at your classmate\u2014she already has three kids, while you're just living for your own passion.</i>\"",
        "And what about those who choose to prioritize their family over their career? They don't escape the scrutiny either. Instead, they hear remarks about how others manage to balance both, how some look as youthful in their 40s as they did in their 20s. \"<i>Why are you tired? You've never worked a day in your life\u2014just sitting at home with the kids.</i>\"",
        "So, as when highlighting the achievements of one woman, let's not diminish the accomplishments of another. Every woman faces struggles that are left outside of the glamorous women's empowerment conferences or mediocre feminist-themed movies.",

      "content": [
        "A short post about my current activities in Abu Dhabi was recently published. Some thoughts remained outside the published text, due to the need to write the material briefly and apparently without criticism :)",
        "During this short interview, I was asked: how is science developing in Kazakhstan today? Perhaps the thought I would still like to share is: science requires large expenditures, and science does not return these expenditures immediately, it's an investment for decades ahead.",
        "At the moment, it is difficult to develop science in Kazakhstan because everyone expects that once you invest in science - there should be an immediate result. In fact, the only university where research is conducted on a large scale at the proper level in our country is subjected to endless criticism (but on the other hand, when a university's budget is comparable to the budget of a small city - the indignation of the population can also be understood).",
        "Kazakhstan is good at using and implementing ready-made technologies in applied areas, from which you can get some output here and now. And this is generally not bad, at the moment it is enough. But this is not science. I think we are a little confused about these two concepts of 'science' and 'technology'. Science requires large investments and guarantees little in return."

In the past, I had transitioned directly from one degree to the next, without any hesitations. But this time, I joined MBZUAI after a year of working experience as a team lead, so it was a mindful decision.",
        "I was quite scared at the beginning, cause during the first months I had to go back and forth from Dubai to Abu-Dhabi, then I had to move to Abu-Dhabi, encourage my husband to do so as well (many thanks for his support btw), search for an apartment and do all that stuff.",
        "But I can confidently say, it's worth it! Even during the first months when I used to spend 4 hours to get to the university and back, it was worth it!",
        "It is such a blessing to be surrounded by people who are striving to knowledge and open to new ideas. And no matter how my path go further, I am already happy for just being surrounded by amazing people. Cause that's what really matters, innit?"
